1. Compute the expected RTT between two birds servers. Assume the bandwidth is 100Mbps, the distance is 50m, the speed of light is 2 x 108 m/s, the packet size is 64 bytes, and there is no queuing delay.


2.  How does your answer to question 1 compare to the RTT you measured? What is the most likely cause of the discrepancy?


3. How do the RTTs to the Colgate core router, router in Albany, and router in
Boston compare? Provide a brief interpretation of the results.


4. How do the bandwidth measurements conducted from the popular and secluded locations compare? What would you expect the results to be and why?
